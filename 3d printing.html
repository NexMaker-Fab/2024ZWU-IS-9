              New applications: 3D printing has been widely used in various
              fields, including healthcare, aerospace, architecture, education,
              etc. For example, in the medical field, 3D printing technology is
              used to manufacture customized prosthetics, teeth, and human organs.
              In the field of architecture, 3D printing technology is used to
              manufacture models and actual building structures.
            </li>
            <li>
              New technology: In 3D printing technology, there is a new technology
              called Selective Laser Melting (SLM). SLM is a 3D printing
              technology that uses a high-power laser beam to melt metal powder
              into a solid, which can manufacture metal parts with complex shapes
              and high strength.
            </li>
            <li>
              New materials: In terms of 3D printing materials, there is a new
              type of material called biomaterials. Biomaterials are materials
              that can be accepted and utilized by living organisms, such as cell
              inks that can be used to manufacture human organs. The emergence of
              this material has opened up new possibilities for 3D printing in the
              medical field.
            </li>
            <li>
              New Machine: In terms of 3D printing machines, there is a new type
              of machine called a multi material 3D printer. This type of machine
              can use multiple different materials in the same printing process to
              create composite objects with multiple properties and functions. 5.
              New paper: In terms of 3D printing paper, there is a new type of
              paper called 3D printing paper. This type of paper is a special type
              of paper that can be used by 3D printers to create three-dimensional
              objects by stacking and bonding them layer by layer. The emergence
              of this type of paper provides a new, low-cost material choice for
              3D printing.

              New applications: 3D printing has been widely used in various
              fields, including healthcare, aerospace, architecture, education,
              etc. For example, in the medical field, 3D printing technology is
              used to manufacture customized prosthetics, teeth, and human organs.
              In the field of architecture, 3D printing technology is used to
              manufacture models and actual building structures.
            </li>
            <li>
              New technology: In 3D printing technology, there is a new technology
              called Selective Laser Melting (SLM). SLM is a 3D printing
              technology that uses a high-power laser beam to melt metal powder
              into a solid, which can manufacture metal parts with complex shapes
              and high strength.
            </li>
            <li>
              New materials: In terms of 3D printing materials, there is a new
              type of material called biomaterials. Biomaterials are materials
              that can be accepted and utilized by living organisms, such as cell
              inks that can be used to manufacture human organs. The emergence of
              this material has opened up new possibilities for 3D printing in the
              medical field.
            </li>
            <li>
              New Machine: In terms of 3D printing machines, there is a new type
              of machine called a multi material 3D printer. This type of machine
              can use multiple different materials in the same printing process to
              create composite objects with multiple properties and functions. 5.
              New paper: In terms of 3D printing paper, there is a new type of
              paper called 3D printing paper. This type of paper is a special type
              of paper that can be used by 3D printers to create three-dimensional
              objects by stacking and bonding them layer by layer. The emergence
              of this type of paper provides a new, low-cost material choice for
              3D printing.
