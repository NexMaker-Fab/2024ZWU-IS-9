            Aluminum is a common metal used in daily life. It&#039;s found in
            kitchen utensils, cans, foils, and even in the construction of
            airplanes and buildings due to its light weight and resistance to
            corrosion.

          Anodizing is a common post-processing method for aluminum. It increases
          resistance to corrosion and wear, and provides better adhesion for paint
          primers and glues. - Plastic (Polyethylene): Injection molding is a
          common post-processing method for polyethylene. It involves heating the
          plastic until it becomes liquid, then injecting it into a mold where it
          cools and solidifies. -
