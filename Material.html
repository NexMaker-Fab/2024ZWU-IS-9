          are a new type of material widely used in packaging and
          anti-counterfeiting printing. The raw materials used for laser
          holographic films mainly include PVC, PET, OPP, BOPP, etc. The varieties
          include laser aluminum coating, laser transparent polishing film, laser
          hot stamping paper, laser transfer paper, etc. The colors include gold,
          silver, red, blue, green, black, etc. Laser holographic materials
          integrate laser holographic image anti-counterfeiting technology with
          printing and decoration technologies such as hot stamping and molding,
          which have good anti-counterfeiting effects. This not only improves the
          decoration effect of the product, but also adds anti-counterfeiting
          performance. In addition, laser holography technology is combined with
          other technologies to produce products such as laser holography with
          fluorescent anti-counterfeiting film, flexible transparent laser
          holography anti-counterfeiting film, and atomic nucleus confidential
          anti-counterfeiting laser holography film, which further improves the
          quality and anti-counterfeiting effect of laser holography film.

          (1) Lightweight: Polyethylene insulation board has a low density and
          weight, which can reduce building loads.
          <br />
          (2) Insulation: Polyethylene insulation board has good insulation
          performance and can reduce energy consumption.
          <br />
          (3) Waterproof and moisture-proof: Polyethylene insulation board has
          excellent waterproof and moisture-proof properties, which can reduce
          leakage.
          <br />
          (4) Easy to construct: The construction of polyethylene insulation board
          is simple and fast, which can shorten the construction period.

          (1) Easy to age: Polyethylene insulation boards are prone to aging over
          time, resulting in a decrease in insulation effectiveness.
          <br />
          (2) Flammable: Polyethylene insulation board is flammable, and safety
          precautions should be taken during construction.

          After inhaling wood dust, it is prone to respiratory and pulmonary
          inflammation. And it&#039;s very painful, so be sure to take good
          respiratory protection measures.
          <br />
          To prevent lung injury, in addition to dust reduction and sealing in the
          work environment, individuals need to scientifically choose dust masks.
          <br />
          <br />
          Dust masks, as special labor protection equipment, must be certified by
          GB2626-2006.
          <br />
          1. Therefore, when choosing a mask, it is also necessary to choose
          according to the national standard. In the national standard, for dust
          and oily particles, protective masks are divided into oil proof (oil
          smoke, oil mist, dust, smoke, mist, microorganisms, represented by KP)
          and dust proof (dust, smoke, mist, microorganisms). For dust prevention,
          there are three levels of protection: KN100, KN95, and KN90. The
          protection rates for ultrafine dust are ≥ 99.97%,&gt;95%, and&gt;90%,
          respectively.
          <br />
          2. Masks are divided into disposable, replaceable filter type half
          masks, and full face masks. For long-term occupational protection use,
          especially in environments with high dust concentration, heavy smoke and
          other ultra-fine particles, it is recommended to use a replaceable
          filter cotton type half face mask. Disposable masks are mostly of no
          size and are relatively low-grade.
          <br />
          3. Mask materials include silicone, plastic, etc. Silicone materials are
          relatively soft and comfortable, with low facial pressure.
          <br />
          4. The size of the mask is divided according to the national standard,
          which is particularly important. Many masks are not numbered, and the
          effect will vary from person to person.
          <br />
          5. There are two types of masks: covering the mouth, nose, and jaw. The
          second type has a large contact mask, good sealing, and low pressure.
          <br />
          6. Do not ignore respiratory protection. Using fake and inferior masks,
          gauze, towels, etc. as masks can easily lead to the occurrence of lung
          diseases. At present, some common N100 level dust masks can ensure
          protection while breat

      Steel parts undergo oxidation treatment to form a protective oxide film on
      the surface, mainly composed of magnetic iron oxide (Fe3O4). The color of
      the film is generally black or blue black, while cast steel and silicon
      steel are brown or black brown.
      <br />
      The oxidation treatment methods include alkaline oxidation, alkali free
      oxidation, and acidic oxidation. Commonly used for the protection and
      decoration of machinery, precision instruments, instruments, weapons, and
      daily necessities.

        1. To polish wood, the first step is to prepare an electric film, a
        grinding machine, and a design drawing. Pop ink lines on the wood, first
        construct a simple shape, and then use a polishing machine.
        <br />
        2. Use a trowel to preliminarily polish to form a rough model, and then
        use different grinding wheels, such as 120 and 320, to polish in order of
        thickness. Next, use sandpaper to directly remove the scratches on the
        surface, and then choose a larger grinding wheel for further polishing.
        The rules are the same as before.
        <br />
        3. After polishing, the next step is to polish. To achieve coloring and
        polishing, sandpaper of different thicknesses should be used for
        polishing. It is necessary to choose the right pigment, which is generally
        water-soluble and has strong permeability. Mix with water in a certain
        proportion and apply it to the wood. After coloring the wood, do not
        immediately dry it. After drying thoroughly, use a clean cloth to
        repeatedly wipe until a uniform gloss is achieved and feels smooth to the
        touch.

          is made by treating with chemicals, peeling off hemicellulose and
          lignin, and can absorb oil from water. The absorption amount is 16-46
          times its own weight, and it can be reused up to 10 times.This new type
          of sponge surpasses all other sponges or absorbers we use today in terms
          of capacity, quality, and reusability.Future development trend: Oil and
          chemical spills have caused unprecedented damage to water bodies around
          the world. As a green way to clean up the ocean, wooden sponges can
          effectively solve this problem.
