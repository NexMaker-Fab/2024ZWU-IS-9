          The choice of material depends mainly on your product needs. For
          example, if your product requires high strength and wear resistance, you
          may want to choose steel or cemented carbide. If your product needs to
          be lightweight and corrosion-resistant, you may want to opt for aluminum
          or plastic. You also need to consider the processability of the
          material, such as machinability, heat treatment properties, etc.

          First of all, you need to determine the machining process and tool route
          according to the drawings or models. Then, you can use dedicated CAM
          (Computer-Aided Manufacturing) software to write CNC programs. This
          program usually includes information such as tool selection, cutting
          parameter setting, tool path planning, etc.

          After the program is written, you need to check the program to make sure
          that there are no errors or omissions. Some CAM software provides a

      G-code, also known as the G programming language, is a programming language
      widely used in CNC machine tools and 3D printers. It consists of a series of
      characters and numbers that are used to guide the movement and operation of
      the machine.
      <br />
      <br />
      G00: Quick positioning, this command allows the machine to move to the
      specified position at the fastest speed.
      <br />
      G01: Linear interpolation, this command causes the machine to move along a
      straight path at a specified speed.
      <br />
      G02: Clockwise circular interpolation, this command causes the machine to
      move along a clockwise circular path at a specified speed.
      <br />
      G03: Counterclockwise circular interpolation, this command causes the
      machine to move along a counterclockwise circular path at a specified speed.
      <br />
      G90: Absolute coordinate system, this command makes all position commands
      relative to a fixed origin.
      <br />
      G91: Relative to the coordinate system, this command makes all position
      commands relative to the current position.

      The program first sets the absolute coordinate system, then quickly moves to
      the position of X10 Y20, then moves to the Z direction at a speed of 100 to
      -5, and finally moves to the position of X20 Y30 in a clockwise arc at a
      speed of 200.
