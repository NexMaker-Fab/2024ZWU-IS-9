          The choice of material depends mainly on your product needs. For
          example, if your product requires high strength and wear resistance, you
          may want to choose steel or cemented carbide. If your product needs to
          be lightweight and corrosion-resistant, you may want to opt for aluminum
          or plastic. You also need to consider the processability of the
          material, such as machinability, heat treatment properties, etc.

          First of all, you need to determine the machining process and tool route
          according to the drawings or models. Then, you can use dedicated CAM
          (Computer-Aided Manufacturing) software to write CNC programs. This
          program usually includes information such as tool selection, cutting
          parameter setting, tool path planning, etc.

          These are just some of the basic steps, and the actual program setup and
          simulation may vary depending on the machine and software. If you are a
          beginner, it is recommended that you learn and operate under the
          guidance of a professional.
