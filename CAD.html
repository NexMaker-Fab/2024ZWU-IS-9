      Learn about Autodesk API: First of all, you need to understand the API
      documents of Autodesk products, which will tell you how to interact with
      Autodesk products and develop plug-ins. Different Autodesk products may have
      different APIs, such as AutoCAD, Revit, Maya, etc.
      <br />
      <br />
      Choose development tools: Plug-ins for Autodesk products usually use
      specific development tools and languages for development. For example,
      AutoCAD plug-ins usually use AutoLISP, Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)
      or. NET and other languages are developed. Revit&#039;s plug-ins can be
      developed using Revit API, C#, Python and other languages. Choose the
      development tools suitable for your Autodesk products and skill level.
      <br />
      <br />
      Write plug-in code: Write the plug-in code according to your needs and the
      API documentation of Autodesk products. This may involve interacting with
      various objects of Autodesk products, such as drawing objects, model
      elements, etc. You can use the functions provided by the API to realise your
      plug-in functions, such as creating new drawing elements, modifying existing
      elements, performing specific operations, etc.
      <br />
      <br />
      Testing and debugging: After writing the plug-in code, it is very important
      to test and debug. Make sure that your plug-in works properly and there are
      no errors or abnormalities. You can test in Autodesk products and debug and
      modify the code as needed.
      <br />
      <br />
      Release and distribution: Once your plug-in is completed and passed the
      test, you can consider publishing and distributing it to other users. You
      can upload the plug-in to the Autodesk plug-in store or other third-party
      platforms for other users to download and use.
