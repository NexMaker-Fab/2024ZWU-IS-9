        printing has significant application potential in the field of skin
        repair. Researchers can maximize skin activity and other natural
        properties by integrating different extracellular matrices into skin 3D
        printing technology, thereby achieving effective repair of damaged skin
        and fusion with normal skin. In addition, for patients with severe skin
        burns caused by fires, 3D printing technology can quickly and accurately
        print materials containing skin cells, construct biomimetic skin
        structures, thereby shortening the treatment cycle and reducing
        postoperative scars.

            In situ skin bioprinting utilizes inkjet bioprinting technology, which
            uses handheld devices or robot automation systems to directly print
            cell filled bioprinting onto the human wound site [6]. This
            bioprinting method can print concentrated skin cell suspensions onto
            wounds to accelerate their healing. Hakimi et al. [14] developed a
            handheld 3D in situ bioprinter that can be directly printed in mouse
            and pig wound models, with cells forming skin patches in situ on the
            wound. Albanna et al. [6] used portable inkjet bioprinters and laser
            bioprinters to print high-density suspensions of human fibroblasts and
            keratinocytes onto full-thickness skin excised wounds in experimental
            mice using fibrin collagen bioprinters. The skin structure printed on
            the wound retains a high cell density, and for up to 6 weeks after
            printing, human cells can also be observed in the tissue. Compared to
            untreated and cell-free grafts, direct in situ skin 3D bioprinting
            therapy leads to faster wound healing.
          </li>
          <li>
            Skardal et al. [7] also evaluated the role of stem cell-derived seed
            cells in wound healing by using a robotic inkjet bioprinter to
            directly print amniotic fluid derived stem cells (AFSC) and fibrin
            collagen bioprinters carrying bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells
            (BM-MSCs) onto the wounds of mice undergoing full layer skin
            resection. Compared with the pure gel control group, the mice treated
            with AFSCs and BM MSCs had faster wound closure and epidermal
            formation. In another experiment to regulate paracrine activity at the
            wound site, Skardal et al. [7] printed heparin coupled hyaluronic acid
            hydrogel containing AFSCs directly on the wound of full-thickness skin
            resection. The hydrogel can isolate the cytokines secreted by AFSC in
            situ, extend paracrine activity, and make the full-thickness wound
            faster closed and vascularized. The main advantage of in situ
            bioprinting is the ability to layer cell ink based on the precise
            shape of the wound, making it particularly suitable for treating
            irregularly

      3D printing, also known as stereoscopic printing or additive manufacturing,
      is a technology that manufactures physical parts based on 3D CAD data
      through the method of layer-by-layer material accumulation. The core
      principle of this technique is to add materials layer by layer, transforming
      the digital design into a physical object.

          There are many materials for 3D printing, including plastics, metals,
          ceramics, gypsum, and even biomaterials. Which material you choose
          depends on the functional and performance needs of the object you are
          printing on. For example, plastics are commonly used to print models and
          prototypes, while metals are often used to print structural parts.

          There are many types of 3D printers, including fused deposition modeling
          (FDM) printers, stereolithography (SLA) printers, selective laser
          sintering (SLS) printers, etc. Different types of printers are suitable
          for different applications, such as FDM printers are often used to print
          plastic parts, and SLS printers are often used to print metal parts.

      G-code, also known as the G programming language, is a programming language
      widely used in CNC machine tools and 3D printers. It consists of a series of
      characters and numbers that are used to guide the movement and operation of
      the machine.
      <br />
      <br />
      G00: Quick positioning, this command allows the machine to move to the
      specified position at the fastest speed.
      <br />
      G01: Linear interpolation, this command causes the machine to move along a
      straight path at a specified speed.
      <br />
      G02: Clockwise circular interpolation, this command causes the machine to
      move along a clockwise circular path at a specified speed.
      <br />
      G03: Counterclockwise circular interpolation, this command causes the
      machine to move along a counterclockwise circular path at a specified speed.
      <br />
      G90: Absolute coordinate system, this command makes all position commands
      relative to a fixed origin.
      <br />
      G91: Relative to the coordinate system, this command makes all position
